						<p><b>Objective</b></p>
						<p>The dictionary meaning of “Luxury” is “experiencing or enjoying expensive, beautiful and comfortable things” while the adjective, “Luxurious”, means “a place or a setting which is full of comfortable, sumptuous, expensive and beautiful elements”. Interestingly, in the interior design domain, these terms are frequently tagged with human habitats such as apartments, villas and row houses, especially bedrooms.

A bedroom is a place where human beings unwind, relax and in these modern times execute some of their professional chores, and therefore this space needs to be carefully planned to offer maximum comfort and inspiration. Mentioned below are some of the important factors to consider while planning and designing a modern luxury bedroom.</p>
